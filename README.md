# sqlalchemy_challenge


## Background

For this challenge I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. Specifically, I utlizied SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I also designed a Flask API based on the queries that I had developed. 


## Synopsis of Process

To tackle this challenge I...

1. Read and decoded the requirements of the challenge.
2. Brainstormed possible structures needed to accomplish the goals of the challenge.
3. Looked back at Bootcamp class activites to find code to accomplish processes.
4. Researched the resources listed below to find additional, or more elegant, code.
5. Cleaned and tested scripts.
6. Update scripts based on feedback.
